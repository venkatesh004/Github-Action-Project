Compile the Java code using Maven and create a JAR file.

2️⃣ Run security checks

Scan your project for vulnerabilities (Trivy).

Check if any secrets are accidentally pushed (Gitleaks).

3️⃣ Run tests

Execute all unit tests to make sure the code works.

4️⃣ Check code quality (SonarQube)

Stop the pipeline if quality does not meet standards.

5️⃣ Build and push Docker image
